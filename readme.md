##Issues##





1) Remove the Alerts for when change relationship - instead add to log
2) When change relationship, refreshes prayer page
3) When click praise button automatically reduces number of prayers, even if you don't have one.
4) Prayerbox shouldn't shrink when focus out. Probably shouldn't enlarge if already enlarged as well.
